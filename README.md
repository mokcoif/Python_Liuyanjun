# Rock Paper scissors in Python!
### An electronic take on a classic game!
#### Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you will only get a vertual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: All you need is [Python](http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0) to play.

Clone the project, navigate to the directory - <code> cd directory name</code> - and run the game.py file in a Python3 Terminal window for Mc / Linux.

The rules are the same as the classic game:
1. Paper covers Rock
2. Scissors cuts Paper
3. Rock smashes Scissors

Choose your weapon wisely!

The computer chooses first; just follow the prompts.

Built with Python 3.

Enjoy!
